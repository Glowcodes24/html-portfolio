 <h3>Crooklyn</h3>
 <p>Honestly, its not the greatest movie in the world but it very nastalgic for me. I remember watchihng this movie a lot when I was a kid and I felt like I related to the main character a lot. She was the only girl of her siblings with 4 brothers, 3 older and one younger. I am the baby girl of my siblings with 3 older brothers. She lived in the hood with parents in an on and off realtionship. Me too!</p>
 <h3>Crazy Rich Asians</h3>
 <p>This movie is just a fun time. Its funny, its drama, its romance, all in one movie. My girlfriend and I love watching this movie together</p>
 <h3>The Woman King</h3>
 <p>Every time I finsh this movie I feel like a powerful black queen that can do anything she puts her mind to. I mean I am but this movie actually makes me feel it.</p>
